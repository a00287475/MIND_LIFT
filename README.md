### Keeping Track of Progress with Commits
- Commits were made regularly with descriptive messages that explain what changes were made. This allowed me to track my progress and easily revert to earlier versions if needed. For example:

Each commit was accompanied by a detailed message explaining the changes to ensure clear documentation of the projectâ€™s progress.

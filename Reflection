# Reflection on Git and Version Control

Using Git and version control systems has significantly impacted the workflow and collaboration on our Mental Health App project. As a team, Git allowed us to manage and track changes effectively. We used branches to create different version of our project, ensured stability in the project. It also provided an easy way to collaborate without overwriting each other's work, as each team member could work on their own branches.

Vishnu contributed by creating models such as EnergyLevel.cs, User.cs and created LoginPage and Created Branches such as initial-stage, Login such that they serve as a version of the project. I also ensured that our Git workflow was smooth, creating branches, committing frequently with detailed messages.

Overall, Git played a crucial role in helping us maintain a clean, organized project and allowed for smooth collaboration across the team, enabling us to work on different features simultaneously without causing disruptions in the main project.

During the development of our Mental Health App, Himani contributed by designing and implementing key data models such as:

MoodEntry.cs – to capture user-submitted mood data.

MoodLog.cs – to store and organize a log of mood entries over time.

Affirmation.cs – to support motivational and positive reinforcement features.

Additionally, I was responsible for designing and developing the Dashboard page, which serves as the main user interface for viewing daily mood summaries, recent entries, and affirmations. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly layout that integrates data from the models and presents it in a meaningful way.

Throughout the project, I actively collaborated with team members through GitHub, ensuring proper version control, code reviews, and regular sync-ups.

This experience helped me strengthen my skills in:

C# and .NET MAUI development.

UI/UX design for mobile interfaces.

GitHub collaboration and workflow management.

Writing modular, scalable code using MVVM.
